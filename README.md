Dice Battle - An Vue.js Study Project

Simple game developed to study Vue.js that present a battle between an hero, the player, and a monster, the enemy.

The game ends when either the hero or monster hits 0 (zero) life points.

Every turn, the hero chooses if he want to attack or to drink potions, which restore his life but the hero have only a limited amount.

If he chose to attack, dices are rolled to check how much damage he'll inflict, then the number is added with his attack points. The monster roll dices the same way to check, then the number is added with their defense points. If the total attack value is bigger than the defense, damage is caused. Otherwise, nothing happens.

Then the monster attacks as well. And the turn ends.

If any dice rolls result in a 20, it's a critical roll and gets an extra dice to roll. The same with result 1, but minus one dice after that.

Good luck!
